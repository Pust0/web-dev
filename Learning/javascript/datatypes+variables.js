//In JS, there are no data types of variables, the data given specifies what type will it be
let num = 1;
let str = "this is a string";
let bool = true;
console.log(num);
console.log(typeof num) //type of tells the type of the data inside the variable, not of the variable

num = "hello world"
console.log(num);
console.log(typeof num)
